              "[{'Text': '(Reuters) - U.S. stocks finished mostly higher on Friday after President Donald Trump announced measures against China in response to new security legislation that were less threatening to the U.S. economy than investors had feared.  The Dow ended the session slightly lower, but all three indexes registered gains for the month and the week.  The S&P 500 initially extended losses after Trump said he was directing his administration to begin the process of eliminating special treatment for Hong Kong in response to China’s plans to impose new security legislation in the semi-autonomous territory.  But Trump made no mention of any action that could undermine the Phase One trade deal that Washington and Beijing struck early this year, a concern that had cast a cloud over the market throughout the week.  “He began speaking in a very tough tone,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. “The market was worried he was going to announce something substantial, something detrimental to the U.S. economy. Then, as he spoke, it became clear the actions being taken were not going to be as dramatic as originally feared.”  Trump also said the United States is terminating its relationship with the World Health Organization, something he had threatened to do earlier this month.  S&P 500 technology shares .SPLRCT gave the index its biggest boost, while financials .SPSY were the biggest drag.  The latest confrontation between the U.S. and China has fueled concern that worsening tensions between the two world’s largest economies could derail the recent sharp gains in the stock market.  Expectations of a quick economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic have driven the S&P 500 .SPX up more than 30% from its March lows.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 17.53 points, or 0.07%, to 25,383.11, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 14.58 points, or 0.48%, to 3,044.31, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 120.88 points, or 1.29%, to 9,489.87.  For the month, the Dow added 3.9%, the S&P 500 gained 4.5%, and the Nasdaq rose 6.8%. For the week, the Dow and S&P 500 each rose more than 3%, and the Nasdaq gained 1.8%.  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Friday that New York City is “on track” to enter phase one of reopening on June 8, and he said five upstate regions will now transition to phase two.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, speaking in a webcast organized by Princeton University Friday, reiterated the U.S. central bank’s promise to use its tools to shore up the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Twitter (TWTR.N) was down 2% and Facebook Inc (FB.O) shares slipped 0.2%, a day after Trump signed an order threatening social media firms with new regulations over free speech.  Upscale department store chain Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) slumped 11% after it reported a near 40% fall in quarterly sales due to pandemic-led store closures.  Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) slipped 3.5% as the cloud-based business software maker cut its annual revenue and profit forecasts.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.04-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favored advancers.  The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 60 new highs and 14 new lows.  Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.62 billion shares, compared to the 11.3 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

              " {'Text': '* Graphic: World FX rates in 2020 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh  * MSCI All Country World Index down 0.1%  * Japanese yen in demand, up 0.4% vs. dollar  * Trump press conference on Hong Kong in focus  By Ritvik Carvalho  LONDON, May 29 (Reuters) - Global stock markets fell and safe havens such as bonds and the Japanese yen gained on Friday, as investors awaited Washington’s response to China tightening control over the city of Hong Kong.  China’s parliament on Thursday pressed ahead with national security legislation for the city, raising fears over the future of its freedoms and its function as a finance hub.  U.S. President Donald Trump said he would hold a news conference on China later on Friday. Trepidation about a further deterioration in Sino-U.S. relations put investors on edge.  European stocks sank, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index down 0.83% by midday in London. Germany’s DAX fell 1%, Britain’s FTSE 100 by 1% and France’s CAC 40 by 0.65%. Futures for the S&P 500 slipped 0.3%.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat. Japan’s Nikkei retreated from a three-month high and the yen rose to a two-week high of 107.06 against the dollar. Bonds rose.  “The question is how far Trump will go at today’s press conference, as removing Hong Kong’s favoured status would probably spark negative market developments, hitting global risk sentiment, which could backfire on the U.S. economy as it would further deteriorate the relationship with China,” strategists at Danske Bank said in a note to clients.  Trump offered a muted response to Hong Kong’s mass democracy protests last year while pursuing a trade deal with China. But ties with Beijing have since soured considerably through the COVID-19 pandemic.  Hong Kong’s government warned on Friday that withdrawing its special U.S. status, which has underpinned it as a finance hub, could be a “double-edged sword” and urged the United States to stop interfering in its internal affairs.  The Chinese yuan weakened in offshore trade.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was 0.8% lower and has lost about 3% in the two weeks since news of China’s security legislation broke.  In bond markets, yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell to 0.6705%, more than 100 basis points below where they began 2020.  Despite the gathering tension and the near-daily release of grim economic data, enormous global stimulus seems to have propped up stocks. The S&P 500 is up 4% for the month and on track for its best May since 2009.  A rally in the risk-sensitive Aussie dollar is slowing, but the currency has gained nearly 2% for the month and sits 20% above March lows.  MSCI’s All Country World Index, which tracks stocks across 49 countries, is on track for a 3.5% gain this week - its best weekly performance since April. The index was down 0.1% on the day.  The optimism stems from signs of progress in the world economy. The number of Americans seeking jobless benefits fell for an eighth straight week last week and New York has outlined plans for re-opening.  “As we have said about the re-opening and ensuing recovery, this is a process,” said RBC Capital Markets’ chief U.S. economist, Tom Porcelli. “And right now the process is moving along in the right direction.”  The euro was headed for its best month since December as the European Union’s 750 billion-euro coronavirus recovery fund fuelled optimism about the EU’s political future. It hit a two-month high of $1.1114 and last traded at $1.1106.  The dollar sank against a basket of currencies, down 0.4%.  Gold rose 0.5% to trade at $1,727.32 an ounce.  In oil, Brent crude fell 2.78% to $34.31 a barrel. U.S. crude fell 3.3% to $32.59 a barrel.  Both contracts are headed for their biggest monthly gains in years as production cuts and optimism about demand recovery led by China supported prices.  London aluminium prices, which stayed flat on Friday, were set for their strongest monthly gain since January 2019, underpinned by a solid recovery in demand from top consumer China.
