Roger Hallam, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, has said the Holocaust was "just another fuckery in human history". 
Hallam believes the Germans' attitude towards the Holocaust is holding them back. "The extremity of a trauma can create a paralysis in actually learning the lessons from it", he told the German weekly DIE ZEIT in an interview.
Talking to DIE ZEIT, the 53-year-old British citizen referenced the Holocaust several times. The "fact of the matter is, millions of people have been killed in vicious circumstances on a regular basis throughout history", Hallam said. He cites, for example, the Belgians, who "went to the Congo in the late 19th century and decimated it".
He notes that genocides have happened repeatedly over the past five centuries: "In fact, you might say it is like a regular event."
